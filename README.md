# 🐶 Pooch Palace Management System (PPM)

Pooch Palace is expanding from a home-based doggie daycare into a full-fledged facility offering day care, boarding, grooming, and training services. As part of this growth, **PPM (Pooch Palace Management)** is a web-based system designed to help manage operations, bookings, and customer engagement for this small business.

This repo contains the frontend implementation using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router** — with plans to integrate a backend for full functionality.
